<h2><u>CSS<//u>란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/about.html#q1.0" target="_blank" title="css">The CSS</a> community has gained significant experience with the CSS2 specification since it became a recommendation in 1998. Errors in the CSS2 specification have subsequently been corrected via the publication of various errata, but there has not yet been an opportunity for the specification to be changed based on experience gained.<p>
